Version 0.1.3

Version 0.1.4
- added ScraperGetPosterBannerV2 Service

Version 0.1.5
- introduced new DB API

Version 0.1.6
- removed outdated field

2015-01-10
- first test version for new DB parser. Currently only series are supported, download of movie data is disabled
- new DB parser should be much faster (only 1/3 of SQL commands)
- with the new DB parser it's now possible to use epgd/scraper2vdr over slow tcp connections (like slow WLAN 802.11b),
because there is much less traffic (binary image data get only copied if image should get updated/loaded)

Version 0.1.7
- first test version for new DB parser with full series and movie support
- thumbnail size is now configurable in setup
  should be set to height which is used by skin to optimze performance of skin (no scaling of thumbs neccessarry)
- full update of series, movies and image files can be triggered from menu/setup
  this will load existing images also (thumbs get created with new size)
- prevent logging of unneccessarry messages (e.g. found nothing to update)
- DB API and LIB porting
- apply new SQL-DB settings without restart of vdr
- changed log-level values:
  0 - only SQL-Connection messages (connected/disconnected...) and errors
  1 - add status messages
  2 - add debug messages (missing images, sql commands...)

Version 0.1.8
- modified makefile to be compatible to launchpad
- add backward compatibility to epgd without recordings.scrsp field (but update to current version is recommended)
- init new setup parameters with values of scraper2vdr < 0.1.7 (Mysql...), so no user actions are necessary after update to scraper2vdr >= 0.1.7

Version 0.1.9
- fixed crash when reconnect to DB (introduced during add backward compatibility)

Version 0.1.10
- setup now react to ok/return keys like other plugins (do not close setup when press ok during edit string parameter)

Version 0.1.11
- add fixed poster size (enabled/defined in setup)
  if is enabled, all posters get stretched/scaled/croped to defined size 
  because of that all thumbnails will have the same size also (using definend thumbnail height)
  this is a enhancement for skin, because now they can calculate with a fixed poster size and aspect ratio
  Warning, this functionality need more CPU power. But the CPU load should not reach problematic levels, because a sleep is used periodically.

Version 0.1.12
- fixed wrong poster thumbnail width in service calls (introduced in 0.1.11)
  this was only a visibility problem, the stored files are ok
- removed option for using new DB parser
- removed all code of old DB parser

Version 0.1.13 (horchi)
- fixed format string handling at call of deleteWhere
- added format string to deleteWhere to avoid buggy format strings
