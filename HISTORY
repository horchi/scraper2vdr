2015-01-10
- first test version for new DB parser. Currently only series are supported, download of movie data is disabled
- new DB parser should be much faster (only 1/3 of SQL commands)
- with the new DB parser it's now possible to use epgd/scraper2vdr over slow tcp connections (like slow WLAN 802.11b),
because there is much less traffic (binary image data get only copied if image should get updated/loaded)

2015-01-11
- first test version for new DB parser with full series and movie support
- thumbnail size is now configurable in setup
should be set to height which is used by skin to optimze performance of skin (no scaling of thumbs neccessarry)
- full update of series, movies and image files can be triggered from menu/setup
this will load existing images also (thumbs get created with new size)
- prevent logging of unneccessarry messages (e.g. found nothing to update)
